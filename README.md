# ISP on PIR
This repo contains my final paper for my independent study project on the private information retrival (PIR) problem. This paper puts together all the published work I read on the PIR problem. I'd like to thank Professor Ariel Hamlin for mentoring my through this independent study and providing useful guidance. The work I did with PIR this semester exposed me to the research process in cryptography and I am excited to continue working in this field.
